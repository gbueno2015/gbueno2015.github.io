     <h3> Summary</h3>
      <h5>
        Guillermo studied at the Kellogg School of Management, where he proved himself a brilliant chemist with a specialty in X-ray crystallography. In my five years of professional career so far, I find myself to be most excited when I own a project from beginning to end and when I can use my creativity to solve challenging problems.  In my last position as administrative manager in Banco Leon, I acted as the right-hand of the head of commercial lending which gave me a very broad view of the bank including: updating the KPIs for the area, strategic planning, meetings with the board of directors, profitability of the bank, find opportunities in new regulatory environment, etc. This was something I really enjoyed about my previous job, but I also believed that I was not as efficient in creating as much value as I felt I could add, since I could only participate in certain parts of the business.
        I enjoy taking calculated risks and feel challenged when I can have an influence in all areas of a business, and not only in a specific unit or department.
